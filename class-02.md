# Class 02 Reading Notes

## Text

There are two categgories of HTML elements when talking about text. **Structural** and **Semantic**. Structural elements such as headings and paragraphs are used to influence a sites asthetics, whereas semantic text is more about accesibility. These include elements like line break, strong and em. Accesibility is important to keep in mind when writing your code.

## CSS

CSS operates on the Box model, it treats everything as if it were in a box & uses rules to determine the style of an element. These rules are made of selectors that specify which element is being targeted and exactly howw it should look. 
Slecetors themselves can also be broken down into two parts. The properties of the element you want to change and their value. CSS can be written directly into an HTML file, or included in a separate file using the link element. This is called **External** and **Internal** CSS. 
Some common types of selectors are :

- Universal
- Type
- Class
- ID


## Basic JavaScript Instructions

A **script** is a series of statements that ends with a semicolon. Each statement should start on a new line as it is a separate instruction for the computer.
**Comments** are tools developers use to organizze their code.
In order to store information, a script will use **variables**. When using a vaibale, you first need to declare it by giving it a name. Once you've done this you need to assign it a **value**

A value can be , numerical, a string or a boolean. 
An **Array** is a variable that can store a list of values.


## Decisions and Loops 

**Decisions** use the results of evaluations to decide * **loops** are for when you want your script to run multiple times. 

## Git Messaging 

When creating a git message, there are a few rules to keep in mind. 

1. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
1. Capitalize the subject line.
1. Do not end the subject line with a period.
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line. 
1. Use the imperitive mood in the subject line.
1. Wrap the body at 72 charactes.
1. Use the body to describe what and why instead of how, which will be illustrated by the code.

These rules help to keep your git messeges clear and concise and allow for easy perusal in the future.

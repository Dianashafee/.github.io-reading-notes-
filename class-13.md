# Local Storage

Native applications have had an advantage over web applications in the past due to their ability to utilize local storage. Databases can also be embedded. 

Eb aplications have had to use cookies, which are imperfect as they add up and slow down the browser, send encrypted info over the internet. 

## Storage before html5 - 

There was a period known as the great browser wars when microsoft pushed internet explorer hard. With this came DHTML behaviors and userData, which allows webpages to store up to 64 km of data. 
Adobe introduced new structures in flash6, google launched something as well.

All of these were reliant on a third party plugin, or a single browser. None of them were standardized. 

So HTML5 sought to make an API that could be utilyzed across browsers without a third party plug in. 

## HTML5v Storage

Web Storaage came out of HTML5, or local storage. This allows web pages to store data within the browser. This is similar to cookies, but is never transfered over the web.

Using it - 

The storeage is based on key/value pairs & is stored based on a named key. Can be anything, but is stored as a string. 

% megabytes is the default storage amount. 

There is another competeing storage type. Indexed Database API.

These work with an "object store" & is similar to SQL.

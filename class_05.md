# Images Color & Text

## Images

When considering images it's important to remember to stay simple and consistnt for a professional look and feel. You can pay for stock images or use free images from the web. Pics are protected by copyright, so you can't just take one you want. 
Some basic funtions of an image are:

* Must be relevant and convey information
* Convey the right mood
* Be recognisable
* Match the color pallette

**Best Practice** Is to store your images on your site within their own folder. Maybe call it images or something. Then break it into subfolders onece your site gets big enough. Really, you just want to consider ease of use and readbility.
Content management sites will usually do this for you. 

the `<img> ` tag is an empty tag and does not require a closing tag, but does need an src and and alt description in case the website doesnt load properly. The src is a file path for the image. **Height** and **width** are also good to keep in mind when adding images to your site. 

When placing an image, remember the in-line and block concepts.

**Rules for placing images**
1. Save images in the right format.
1. Save images at the right size.
1. Measure images in pixles.

There are tools that can be used to edit images, with photoshop being one of them. It's important to keep in mind height, width, pixels and what format you want to use. Gifs and jpegs for instance. You can also make your images transparent. PNG is useful for this. Figure and fifcaption can be used to hold several different images.


## Color

Color brings your page to life!!

The color property allows you to set the color of you text, this can be done in three different ways. **RGB values**, **Hex Codes**, **Color Names**. (Theres also HSLA) Each are good in thier own way.

**Background-color** is self explanatory and can be utilized in the same way as color with rgb, hex or color names. If you don't, the background will be transparent.
Color on computers is created by mixing amounts of red, green and blue. **hue**, **saturation**, **brightness** are important to keep in mind when choosing color.

By keeing these in mind it will help your site to be readable.

**RGBA** allows you to choose a color  but also its **opacity**. 
**HSLA** lets you pick colors using hue, saturation and lightness along with opacity.


## Text 

Text is important when conssidering readability of yor site. 
When considering what typeface you want to use keep in mind that a browser will only display i if it's installed on the users computer, so you should supply several options in your code by using **font-families**. You can specify an order of preference in these options. 

Examples of typefaces:

* Serif
* Sans Sefrif
* Monospace
* Cursive
* Fantasy


Type faces are subject to copyright, like images. 
**font-size** allows you to specify the size of the font. Sizing useing **pixels** allows for greater control over how much space the text takes up. **Percentages** let you set a default size. **ems** are equivelant to the size of an m. 

The **font-weight** propety allows you to create bold text. **font-style** lets you create italic text. **text-transform** can be used to change the case of text using either uppercase, lowercase or capitalize. **text-decoration** lets you use underline, overline, line-through, blink.

Text can be alighned to the left, right, center. You can also use justify to make the text take up all the room in its container.

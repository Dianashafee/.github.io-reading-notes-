# Class Four Reading Notes

## Links - 
**Links** allow the user to move quickly from one page to another, or surf.
Some commor links are. Page to page, site to site, links that open another window, and links that open your email.

To create a link you need to wrap an href attribute in an opening anchor tag. You close it and add descriptive text between them.

This link will be clickable for the user.

When linking to another site you use the **Absolute** url. When linking within the same page you use the **relative** url. This means you don't need to define the domain.

With large projects its best to use separate **directories**bfor each page. 



## Layout - 

When considering layout the box model is the standard. Your boxes will either be **Inline** or **Block**, or both if you include the proper attributes. Block level elemnts start a new line, while inline falls with in the text.

Nesting a block level elemnt in another blocklevel elemnt creates a contaoning or parent element.

There are three positioning schemes in css. 

* - Normal Flow
* - Relative Postioning 
* - Absolute Positioning

**Float** lets you move any element to the laft or right as much as you'd like.

It's important tot keep the design of your site flexible for different sized screens.

## - Functions, Methods and Objects

Finctions, methods and objects are used to keep code organized and concise.

Functions let you group a series of statements togetherto perform a specific task
There are three types of function - 

* - BAsic- 
* - Anonymous
* - Immediately invoked Function Expressions

**Variable Scope** - Where you declare your variable effects where they can be used. This is the scope. Scope can be local or global. Either can be useful or detrimental to your code depending on what you want to do.

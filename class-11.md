You can control the size of an image using css. Doing this helps with loading times. Using consistently sized images allows the use of css instead of html.

Instead of including height and width properties in the html, put them in the css using classes. 

Use float to align images. You can also use align left or align right. For centering, turn the image into a block level element bthen center it.

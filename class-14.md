**Psychological Safety** 
Google's Quest to build the perfect team. 

According to the article "groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together."

Google Wanted to know more though. They wanted to dig deeper and discover what truly makes a great team. 

Thus, they began Project Aristotle.

They combed over previous research, statistics and data, but couldn't find any pattern. 

This is the point where the researcher Rozovsky made a bit of a breakthrough. "Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound.Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team."

Through thtis they discovered that understanding and influencing a groups norms was the key to improvement. The question sthen, was which norms were the most important?

They found that when people come together thay have a sort og, group IQ, that eclipsese that of any single individual. What it came down to was how the teammates interacted and treated each other. They all spoke the same amount. Equality in distibution.

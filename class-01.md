## Structure
**HTML** or Hyper Text Markup Language is used to create the bones of a site. It is text based language that uses opening and closing tags to organize information into containers.**Elements** and tags are interchangeable. Attributes can be added to a tag to give it further meaning by adding a value to it. 
Structure helps viewers better understand the content they are consuming. 
**Headings** and **subheadings** are used to create a heiarchy of information. 
 

## Extra Markup

There are tools that can be utilized within your code that help make it clearer for both yourself and the consumer. Things like, comments, **id & class, div & span**,global attributes,  and a few other things.

There were several iterations of HTML before **HTML5**, which is the one used most widely today. HTML4 & XHTML, changes were made to it over time until it became the language it is today. 
Comments are a way to organize your code, or take something in or out to see how it effects the overall appearance of your site. 
```
<!-- -->
```
Id and Class attributes allow you target certain elements within your code for styling. 

When coding you will run into tow types of elements. **Inline** and **Block** Block level elements will stack on top of one another, while inline will continue on the same line. You can change the way these appear by using div & span. 
*Block elements-*
```
<h1>
<p>
<ul>
```
*Inline Elements-*
```
<a>
<img>
```


## HTML5 Layout
HTML5 Added several new elements to help with clarification and syntax. Instead of using div for everything it added elements such as, header, footer, nav, article, and aside. These make it easier to keep your code clear and organized. 
```
<div></div>
<header></header>
<footer></footer>
<nav></nav>
<article></article>
<aside></aside>
```


## Process & Design

When considering the layout and design of a site you should always put yourself in the shoes of your potential consumer. You want to make you site as accesible as possible. Make sure you are using color in a way that includes everyone. Take into account ARIA roles. Remember the ALT descriptions for images, etc.


## ABC's of Programming

A **script** is a series of precise instructions for the computer. 
You can assign **variables** to store information within the script.
**Arrays** are variables that store more than one piece of information.
A **boolean** is a true or false statement. 
**Expressions** evaluate into a single value and rely on **operators** to calculate them.
